>  I was in a small local mexican restaurant(with a little bar) once called Via Sombrero...they claimed to have the "best margaritas in town"...well..maybe the strongest...anyway I was sitting next to a fellow and the conversation drifted to New Orleans..where he was from..so I said "New Orleans...I always wanted to go"...he  put down his best margarita and said to me.."it's Nawlons...if you're gonna say it..say it right...well...I have looked at a LOT of node books...and this one written by *Jim R. Wilson* who works at Google..looks to me like a good one..cause...if you are gonna do node...do it right..
