You might be wondering what this entry is about.  Over the years, I have used all kinds of tools to keep notes.  The yellow Sticky thing that floats
around, notepad, textmate, google docs and a google chrome extension,  Evernote..actually Evernote is my main base now, but for quick and dirty i use something else. 
Actually now that I think about it, I have used so many "note" keeps that I have lost a lot of notes in the morass over the years.  Hopefully
that will change!

I just want something that is always around, fast, and easy to use.  I discovered
Notational Velocity [National Velocity Website](http://notational.net/).

To make a very long story short.  I love NV and I use it daily. I just like the way it works.  Simple and fast.  Give it a  look-see.
