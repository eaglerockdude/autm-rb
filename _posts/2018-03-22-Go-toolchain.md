## The GO tool-chain
The GO tool-chain(which is used to compile apps) supports application development.  Itprovides for testing, formatting, and documentation, as well as package management.

## Project Folder Structure
When you develop GO applications the toolchain expects that you use a "workspace" that has a specific folder and directory structure.  This in a sense is similar to ROR rails, which has a folder structure also.
