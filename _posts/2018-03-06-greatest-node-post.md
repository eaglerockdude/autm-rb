I think maybe Dr. Suess must have said that one first...anyway...there are hundreds..maybe thousands of posts on blogs on the web about NODEJS and the Loop and blocking/non-blocking..but they all seem to lead back to this one...probably the GREATEST NODEJS POST ever written.  All related posts here seem to go back to there.
