## Reaction to React
 Like everyone else, I see that React is taking the world by storm
or so it would seem.  I heard a Ruby Rogues podcast by DHH and he said:
   
 >"Still not a big fan on the framework side of things...React's approach is sound but pairing up with redux..well is more convoluted and self-congratulatory in its complexity than anything I have seen since the dark ages of J2EE...and we have spent two decades on separation of concerns, and now react just says...Hey..lets put it all in the same box....that said...I found that a lot of the problems the new javascript technologies propose to solve are not problems that I have..."
 
 I think I am going to wait till the hype dies down when and if I see a practical application.  Not saying its bad or good, only that maybe its too much sugar for a dime as they say. Time will tell.
