## Glossary of rails terms(with links if applicable)
 
* [spring](https://github.com/rails/spring) 
Spring is a Rails application preloader. It speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background so you don't need to boot it every time you run a test, rake task or migration. 

* [turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)
