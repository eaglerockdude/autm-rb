> "I am the coolest of all time!"    (probably said by "The Fonz" )

I went to the [libuv](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/design.html) website which is a support library written for 
node.js for I/O polling mechanisms.   It has to do with the event loop and things like that.  I was wowed when I saw their logo...just too cool.
