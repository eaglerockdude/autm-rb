  First post of the new year...been pretty busy picking up some Python and data science knowledge.
  
  I converted my Jekyll blog to a new template, because after the Jekyll update to 3.0 I just had too many weird things going on and I was tired of fixing them.  Time to move on and upgrade. I don't expect as much trouble as an OS upgrade right?  I miss Steve Jobs.

### Permalinks
   
   Defining a Permalink in the Front Matter of an individual page will override the default for both pages and posts, allowing us to specify exactly what we want the link to be on a per-file basis. For example,  in the About page set the permalink value to: 
   
    permalink: "about/index.html"
    
 This give us a simple link to our about page.
