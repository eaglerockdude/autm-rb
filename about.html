      <h2>About this blog</h2>
      <p>This site is really about introducing myself to the world as it relates to programming.  It's not really a place
      where I will make comments about the decline of our "empire" or global warming.</p>
      <p>It is also not a place where I will repeat things that are freely available on places like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide">Microsoft Developer Network</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>...I mean that's what those sites are for and hopefully I don't need to produce FILLER in order for you to think I can work for you.  That said, what I do what to show here is what I think I understand about the technologies I use.  Actually...I make you a promise(Not the ES6 kind)...if I state or restate something here, it means that I have studied, coded, and understand it.  And normally it will be things that are beyond the basic things like the operations that can be performed on an array.  What is the point of that?</p>
      <P>It will high-lite what to me were "light-bulb" moments that to me were the "finally" explanation that opened the door of understanding to walk thru.  So for me its a note in case I forget.  And for each person that is most likely different.  But in that case I would think that my view of how I came to grok something might actually be useful to someone else in the same boat.  That's about it.  Because I do believe that it you want something, you need to give it.  For me knowledge is one of those things.</P>
      <p>I also will have links to actual code or applications that I have written that reinforce that understanding. </p>
