    <p>This section of my site will contain coding notes and observations on the Golang(Go) programming language and some C. GO is mainly my focus but I like to sprinkle some 'C' in there dependent on time. I find that looking and coding GO & C exercises the muscles I have that seem to get weak from sitting on the ROR couch all day. Also is in keeping with my belief that reviewing multiple languages is always a benefit to the main language you happen be focused on.  You see coding approaches/idea's that open you mind a bit.</p>

    <h1 class="std_hdg_color">The C Programming Language</h1>
    <p>I have come across references to The C programming language many times in my career...in the following sense..I see constructs in java or C# or javascript or python or ruby or perl...Swift/objective C...just about any language..and they all show their roots in C.  If fact even the operating systems of the IBM platforms i used to work on were written in C/C++. Most open source languages have libraries underneath which came from C.</p>

    <h1 class="std_hdg_color">The GO(golang) Programming Language</h1>
    <p>GO was created by a few of the guys who created C as sort of a replacement.  At Google Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson were attempting to create a
        language  for  modern  systems  programming
        that  solved  real
        -world  problems  they
        encountered while building large systems at scale.</p>

    <p>Some interesting things about GO:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It has a built in package system</li>
        <li>It has a built in tools for testing, documentation and a code-formatter.</li>
        <li>Natively supports multiple function return values with out some type of hacking</li>
        <li>Concurrency with goroutines and channels</li>
        <li>GO has a built in webserver since it does not need one to do the multi-threading among other things.</li>
