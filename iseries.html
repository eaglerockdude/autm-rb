<Main class="">
 <h1 class="std_hdg_color">iSeries/as400</h1>
 <p>The purpose of this page is to high-lite my varied programming experience across a multitude of businesses. I am a senior iSeries guy, and in the Rails its hard to quantify.  I would say I am a raw rails developer in the 1-2 year range but because of my varied experience have seen a lot.</p>
<p>For many years I worked on a platform call the AS/400 or iSeries. It's an IBM machine used by many large companies.  It's operating system is OS/400 or now i5/OS, and normally the database is DB/2. It was really big for large packages for accounting and manufacturing in particular.  And of course custom development.  Some of the companies that used it or still have are :  Disney, Countrywide/Bank of America, Microsoft, Technicolor/Universal, Guess, Warner Bros., Costco(still), and many large hotels in Las Vegas like MGM.  And these were just off the top of my head.</p>
 <p>I am now moving to open source technologies and in particular Ruby on Rails, but I have been a programmer for 20 years.  I have experience on the business side of development from my previous platform in:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Manufacturing</li>
  <li>Insurance</li>
  <li>Banking and Finance</li>
  <li>Media Buying and Advertising</li>
  <li>Distribution/Warehouse</li>
  <li>Apparel Industry</li>
  <li>Probably more..</li>
 </ul>
