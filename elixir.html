      <h2>Notes/Posts on Elixir and Phoenix</h2>
      <p>So there is really smart guy named Jose Valim who wrote one of my favorite rails books...Crafting Rails Applications..so a few years ago I saw he was working on some new project with an odd name.  The project or language was <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> and turns out the syntax is VERY ruby-like.  Obviously because he was one of the core contributors to rails and a ruby expert.  In fact it seems lots of Rails developers are moving to it for that reason.  And in particular it addresses the infamous scalability problem without which rails would probably rule the web world.  It is based on a language called Erlang.</p>
      <blockquote>"Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.  All Elixir code runs in lite threads of execution.  Due to their lightweight nature, it is not uncommon to have hundreds of thousands of processes running concurrently in the same machine.." (from the Elixir-lang.org website)</blockquote>

      <p>It looks very cool and I can't wait when I have some time to try some things out.  There is also a rails like framework called <a href="http://phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> which is to elixir as rails is to ruby.</p>
