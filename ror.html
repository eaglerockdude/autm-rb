 <h1 class="std_hdg_color">Ruby on Rails</h1>
 <p>This is a collection of posts related to Ruby on Rails and Ruby.  When I changed from my previous IBM platform to the web paradigm and open source, I originally started with PHP but soon moved to rails.  I knew even at that time that some big users of rails were actually moving to other solutions due to "scaling" concerns.</p>
 <p>But, I reasoned that really, how many companies really are going to get THAT big where that would be a concern?  Even Basecamp the company where DHH works still uses rails and quite a few others.</p>
 <p>To me...rails gives you SO MUCH...it gives you standards in terms of your site layout, a great community for getting answers to questions/issues, and it incorporates important concepts like REST and engines and templates and databases and javascript integration...all on top of one of the best languages in terms of syntax in the world...ruby.  Not to mention the speed with which you can add functionality with Gems..</p>
 <p>My only complaint really from a personal perspective is the "magic" of how functionality is implemented...you just feel better when you can see the lower level code....but in fact, almost all modern languages at some level abstract those details away from the coding in the name of development speed...so with rails its just a matter of degree.</p>
 <p>I am a bit torn however...I do like the ubiquitousness of javascript and performance model of nodeJS...so at this point my focus is ROR and nodeJS.  These days you are forced to be a bit of a polygot anyway.</p>
