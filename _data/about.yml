## Introduction

Hi.  I am Ken McFadden. I am developer specializing in Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Python, R(R language data science, Tableau, and also in the past an iSeries Developer.
Thank you for visiting.

## Services

I currently offer Ruby/Ruby on Rails & IBM iSeries/DB2 consulting.  Soon I hope to be offering
Python and R Language as well as Tableau.  Basically data analysis with a programmer emphasis.

* I do the job right and keep it simple.
* Agile and TDD/BDD test driven and behavior driven development.
* Project Management expertise.
    * The plan is nothing, the planning is everything. (attributed to Dwight D Eisenhower during the planning for D-day the invasion of Normandy)
    * When the map and the terrain differ, believe the terrain.
    * There is no limit to what you can achieve if you don't care who gets the credit.
* Useful Repertoire of Deep Thoughts.  Fun guy(relatively).
    * "Hard work makes up for lack of brains..."

## My Philosphy on programming
    * There are many solutions to any given problem or task.
    * Each person because of the individualy of each mind and spirit most 
      likely will have a different way of doing things.
    * Its's important to realize that after taking into consideration experience lever
      etc of the person, all things being equal, their may not be a best way, or at least
      it't probably not worth the time to debate or argue.
    * Consider the facts, choose a solution, and adjust as and if necessary. Move on as there
      is too much to do.
