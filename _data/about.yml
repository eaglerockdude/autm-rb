  Hello.  My name is Ken McFadden.  Born and raised in So. Cal I spent my formative years(always wanted to say that..can you say "tacos?" in San Diego, but have called Los Angeles my home for the
  past 25 years.  In my early career I coded on IBM Midrange systems from system/38 to as/400 to iseries, and I am an expert in all flavors of the RPG language and Sql/DB2.
  in that.  Always open to a quick contract.
  
  I have moved to open source technologies and web.  My favorite coding environment and language is ruby and Ruby on Rails, but
  recently have been picking up some Python/Tableau/R in relation to data science.  You never know when it could come in handy.
  
  On the front end I know HTML/CSS/Javascript/BootStrap and am adding some REACT to my vocabulary as we speak.
  
  This website is under construction meaning the junk below is placeholder for a .yml file.  I was having some issues with the github
  blowing up on the parsing so I am moving down the page and building as I go.  You know how that goes. :>)

  FYI this is a Jekyll based static website which is simple and free.
  
  Unordered

  + Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
    - Marker character change forces new list start:
      * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
      + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
      - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
  + Very easy!
