  Hello.  My name is Ken McFadden.  Born and raised in So. Cal I spent my formative years(always wanted to say that) in San Diego, but have called Los Angeles my home for the
  past 25 years.  In my early career I coded on IBM Platform systems from system/38 to as/400 to iseries, and I am an expert in all flavors of the RPG programming language and SQLRPG and DB/2 as well
  as the operating system and CL programming language.  That machine is so old recruiters often call it a "mainframe" but back in the day
  it was called midrange, not mainframe.  Mainframe is Cobol!  Anyway...I made a good living on that machine but like anything else
  sooner or later companies want GUI and free software(free programmers too!) so it was time to expand.

  I have transitioned to open source technologies and web.  My favorite coding environment and language is ruby and Ruby on Rails, and
  my secondary focus is javascript and anything interesting. Front end comes in handy with anything on the web and even mobile these days. I have actually
  studied more programming languages than I can remember(Perl,Java,Python,Nodejs etc) but you have to choose one at some point. Python is not bad but honestly unless you are going to do a lot of data science stuff, I don't see the desire there for me..since pythons is used a lot for data analyis(numpy/panda/data series/dataframes and all that) in the final analysis its just
  spreadsheets, so I figured cut out the middleman and just do Tableau.
  
  This website is under construction meaning the junk below is placeholder for a .yml file.  I am upgrading my Jekyll site 
  to a newer version as the old one just got too jambled.  You know how that goes. :>)

  ## I offer Ruby on Rails contract maintenance right now.  Or iSeries for a quick contract.
