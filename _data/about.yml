  Hello.  My name is Ken McFadden.  Born and raised in So. Cal I spent my formative years(always wanted to say that..can you say "tacos?" in San Diego, but have called Los Angeles my home for the
  past 25 years.  In my early career I coded on IBM Midrange systems from system/38 to as/400 to iseries, and I am an expert in all flavors of the RPG language and Sql/DB2.
  in that.  Always open to a quick contract.
  
  I have moved to open source technologies and web.  My favorite coding environment and language is ruby and Ruby on Rails, and
  my secondary focus is javascript and React.  Front end comes in handy with anything on the web and even mobile these days. I have actually
  studied more programming languages than I can remember(Perl,Java,Python,Nodejs etc) but you have to choose at some point.
  
  
  This website is under construction meaning the junk below is placeholder for a .yml file.  I am upgrading my Jekyll site 
  to a newer version as the old one just got to jambled.  You know how that goes. :>)
