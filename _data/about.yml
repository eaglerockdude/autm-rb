  Hello.  My name is Ken McFadden.  Born and raised in So. Cal I spent my formative years(always wanted to say that..can you say "tacos?") in San Diego, but have called Los Angeles my home for the
  past 25 years.  In my early career I coded on IBM Midrange systems from system/38 to as/400 to iseries, and I am an expert in all flavors of the RPG language and SQLRPG and DB/2 as well
  as the operating system and CL programming language.  That machine is so old recruiters often call it a "mainframe" but back in the day
  it was called midrange, not mainframe.  Mainframe is Cobol!  Anyway...I made a good living on that machine but like anything else
  sooner or later companies want GUI and free software(free programmers too!) so it was time to expand.

  I have moved to open source technologies and web.  My favorite coding environment and language is ruby and Ruby on Rails, and
  my secondary focus is javascript and React.  More so the javascript.  Front end comes in handy with anything on the web and even mobile these days. I have actually
  studied more programming languages than I can remember(Perl,Java,Python,Nodejs etc) but you have to choose one at some point. Python is not bad
  and in retrospect I should have chosen that, but that ship has sailed.  Maybe someday.  Story of my life.  Always guessing wrong. I have the
  same luck with stocks. But...since pythons is used a lot for data analyis(numpy/panda/data series/dataframes and all that) in the final analysis its just
  spreadsheets, so I figured cut out the middleman and just do Tableau.  I am working on it as a sidline.
  
  This website is under construction meaning the junk below is placeholder for a .yml file.  I am upgrading my Jekyll site 
  to a newer version as the old one just got too jambled.  You know how that goes. :>)

  ## I offer iseries consulting and rOR freelance maintenance right now.  email me to get the ball rolling.
