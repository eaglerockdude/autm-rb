    <p class = 'creed'>Everyone knows that rails is able to generate code for all the bits and pieces necessary for a complete website via a lot of code under the surface, the so called rails "magic"...while I like a good magic show programming is not the same thing.  Just like I understand the components of my car so when if if breaks down somewhere inconvenient, I may have chance to get it going again or at least know what happended, the same goes for rails.  I make it a point to not only understand how to use rails, but also understand the ruby code underneath.  To me they go hand in hand.</p>
