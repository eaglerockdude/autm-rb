    <p class = 'creed'>Everyone knows that rails is able to generate code for all the bits and pieces necessary for a  website via a lot of code under the surface, the so called rails "magic"...while I like a good magic show programming is not magic.  Just like I understand the workings of my car so if it breaks down I have a better chance to get it going again or at least know how to proceed, and the same goes for rails.  I think it's best to not only understand rails, but also understand the ruby code underneath.  To me they go hand in hand. It makes for a smoother drive.</p>
