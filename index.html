    <p class = 'creed'>Everyone knows that rails is able to generate code for all the bits and pieces necessary for a  website via a lot of code under the surface, the so called rails "magic"...while I like a good magic show programming is not magic.  Just like I understand the workings of my car so it breaks down somewhere inconvenient, I have a better chance to get it going again or at least know how to proceed, and the same goes for rails.  I make it a point to not only understand how to use rails, but also understand the ruby code underneath.  To me they go hand in hand.</p>
